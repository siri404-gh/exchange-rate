# Running app locally

&nbsp;

Run `npm run build:client:devserver` in one tab to start the client at `http://localhost:9000` and run `nodemon src/server/mock` in another to start the server parallely at `https://localhost:5000`.


To run with SSR, just do an `npm start`. But there is no HMR. You will have to stop and start every time you make a change be it the client or server.
